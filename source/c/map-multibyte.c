 * First phase of the translation process. From the spec:
 * Physical source file multibyte characters are mapped, in an
 * implementation-defined manner, to the source character set
 * (introducing new-line characters for end-of-line indicators) if
 * necessary. Trigraph sequences are replaced by corresponding
 * single-character internal representations.
