 * Third phase of the translation process. From the spec:
 * The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens and
 * sequences of white-space characters (including comments). A source
 * file shall not end in a partial preprocessing token or in a partial
 * comment. Each comment is replaced by one space character. New-line
 * characters are retained. Whether each nonempty sequence of
 * white-space characters other than new-line is retained or replaced
 * by one space character is implementation-defined.
